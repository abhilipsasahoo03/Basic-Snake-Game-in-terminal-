# Basic-Snake-Game-in-terminal-
Simple Snake Game using C 
Some basic functionalities of the game:
1. It takes input from keyboard—

       a- Takes name of the player as an input and then displays it throughout the game. 
       b- Input to move the snake and change its course in any direction
         'W' or 'w' — Up
         'S' or 's' — Down
         'A' or 'a' — Left
         'D' or 'd' — Down
         
2. When the snake eats the fruit, the score increases by 10.
3. After every successful stage, the fruit is randomly generated at any point within the gameboard.
4. If the snake touches the boundary line, game is over. 
5. Displays and correspondingly updates score. 

Functionalities not present:
1. The snake doesn't grow after successfully eating the fruit. Hence, the size remains the same and it doesn't have any head or tail. 
2. The snake doesn't automatically move, and the speed doesn't increase after every successful stage.
3. Unlike the usual playable snake game in mobile phones, here if the snake hits the boundary, it doesn't get into the board from the opposite boundary. 
4. Lacks better UI/UX.
